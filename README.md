# Draft-CW-Script
I created this draft CW script just to play Fun CW with some friends, and i decided to publish it now.
If you don't know what draft CW is, simply it is a clan war between two teams where the players need to take checkpoints distributed around the map, each point is counted for the player's team.

# General Info About The Script

1- The script needs DGS to work, if you don't know what DGS is please visit the following link https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Resource:DGS where you can donwload DGS and add it to your server.<br>
2- The script is made to work with the default Race gamemode and the default mapmanager (it can work with a different race gamemode as long as it is based on the default Race gamemode).<br>
3- The script needs Admin rights.
